## Features

### 1. Table Configuration

- Waiters can configure the tablet to the last used table number or change it using their login credentials.

### 2. Table Status Differentiation
- Customers can differentiate between booked and available tables.
- Pre-booked tables show a booked screen, while available tables display the food menu.

### 3. Menu Display
- The system displays the menu, available items, and offers on the tablet.
- Menu items are categorized for easy navigation (appetizers, main courses, desserts, beverages).

### 4. Order Placement
- Customers can place orders in two ways:
  - **Virtual Waiter Interface:** Customers can tap on item cards, add details, and confirm the order.
  - **Through a Waiter:** Waiters, equipped with tablets, can add orders by providing table numbers and food items.

### 5. Multiple Orders in One Session
- Customers can select and place multiple orders in a single session until they decide to check out.

### 6. Real-time Order Updates
- The system provides real-time updates on the status of each order:
  - Ordered
  - Preparing
  - Prepared
  - Delivering
  - Delivered

### 7. Database Updates
- The system updates the database when a customer places an order.
- Database updates occur when chefs update the order status, reflecting changes in real-time.

### 8. Session Management
- Customers can end the session by tapping the checkout button.
- They can leave feedback, rate their dining experience (1-5), and write a review if desired.
- The session automatically ends if there is no user input for 1 minute, allowing the app to reset for the next customer.
